# Hi there, I'm Piper
Thanks for checking out my profile!
## About Me
* I'm a second year computer science major at Northeastern University, with a concentration in software.
    * Although only a second year, I'm currently on track to graduate from Northeastern in the 2026 fall semester, given ideal conditions. 
* I've been interested in computers, coding, and creating since my childhood.
    * My first introduction to programming was through MIT's Scratch in elementary school.
    * As my interest in coding grew throughout grade school, I started to teach myself more about computer science - learn more below!
* In my free time, I enjoy skateboarding, playing guitar, playing video games, and hanging out with friends.
    * I also like to develop video games on my own, but you'll see those on my profile!
